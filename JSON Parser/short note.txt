parser pretty much works perfectly, got max points for it.
If you wish to use it, JPath has few little problems and saving as well.
Propably caused by lack of tests and time to implement it well and test.

And I don't know if empty Arrays/Maps are allowed and just values like string or number
Everything else pretty much works perfecty
