# Hi!
My name is Oskar and in this repository I would like to share with you my projects that describe my skills in various languages!
### Repository structure
Each folder represents a project, each project has a short readme file that describes the project and shows result.
You can of course download these files and check them on your own!

#### What languages do I use?
- `C++`
  + Data structures and algorithms
  + SFML
- `C#`
  + Games (Flax Engine)
  + Discord bots (Dsharp)
  + Desktop applications (WinForms)
  + Web development (Currently learning ASP.NET Core MVC)
- `Java`
  + Basic dekstop applications (Swing)
- `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`
  + Basic websites
  + Website games
- `Databases`
  + `SQLServer`
  + `PostgreSQL` (academic experience)
  
### Future plans
In the future I plan learning Unity and develop my skills in algorithms as well as mastering my current skills
### How do I learn?
To learn stuff I use specialistic books. I choose books that have **excersises** and are **recommended** by other programmers
#### The best books I have ever read:
- *Programming. Principles and practice using C++* - Bjarne Stroustrup
- *Murach's ASP.NET Core MVC* - Joel Murach, Mary Delamater
- *HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites* - Jon Duckett
- *JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development* - Jon Duckett  

There are more books that I have read, but I don't consider them as valuable as books above

**I hope you will find a good time searching through my code :)**
