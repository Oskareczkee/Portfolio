##Future plans
In the future i plan learning Unity and master my skills in algoriths as well as mastering my actual skills
##How do i learn?
To learn stuff i use specialistic books. I often choose books that have **excersises** and are **recomennded** by other programmers
#The best books that i have read:
-*Programming. Principles and practice using C++* - Bjarne Stroustrup
-*Murach's ASP.NET Core MVC* - Joel Murach, Mary Delamater
-*HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites* - Jon Duckett
-*JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development* - Jon Duckett
There are more books that I have read, but I don't consider them as valuable as books above

**I hope you will find a good time searching through my code :)**
